# 普通人突破封锁的实际目的

Speaking of ScrambleSuit, most people doing anti-censorship research outside China often don't realize that actually we don't care about censorship. They thought we're curious about uncensored news, and we're eager to find out what the government has blocked recently. Unfortunately that's not true. Nobody is gonna do that. Most people just want to watch silly gameplay videos on YouTube, share their silly photos on Instagram, download pirate or porn movies, play online PC or PS4 games that are often too slow without using a proxy. If we really were a freedom loving nation, we won't have such a firewall.

Compared to those projects from outsiders, the tools that Chinese people invented have one characteristic in common: speed. We have high goodput and low latency, even better than most of the VPN protocols.
